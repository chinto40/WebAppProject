    Mama, just killed a man <br>
    Put a gun against his head<br>
    Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
    Mama, life had just begun<br>
    But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
    Mama, ooh<br>
    Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
    If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
    Carry on, carry on<br>
    As if nothing really matters<br>
    Too late, my time has come<br>
    Sends shivers down my spine<br>
    Body's aching all the time<br>
    Goodbye everybody, I've got to go<br>
    Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
    Mama, ooh<br>
    I don't want to die<br>
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
